# JS Libraries

In this chat with Leo, we'll discuss the wonderful world of JavaScript libraries, and how you can use them in your project and add them as a dependency. We will discuss graphing libraries, font packs, math libraries, and animation ones too!
* Graphing with plotly
* Icons with fontawesome
* Numpy-like math with numjs
* Animation with animejs

By the end of this, we should know how to...
* Pick out the right library to use
* Add it as a dependency
* Use it in our React app

## Picking a Library

Now I'm sure that you've all heard this before, but if you haven't then listen up! There are a few things that one should always consider when picking out a library for use in a webapp. They come in the form of questions:
* Does this library do what I want it to?
* Does this library *look nice*?
* Is the documentation clear?
* Is the interface easy to use? Or is it cumbersome?

If you can answer these questions with a confident "yes", then the library is a good contender! Make sure to compare a number of libraries before you do, though.

There's also often a trade-off between ease-of-use and control. If you want something that is incredibly detailed and allows you to handle every facet of the operation, you're going to sacrifice a good deal of ease-of-use, since the abstractions provided by a library are what we look for to begin with.

In any case, with that out of the way, let's take a look at a few JavaScript libraries that you might want to use in your project. More specifically, we'll look at how we can use them in a React webapp.

## `plotly`

...

## `fontawesome`

...

## `numjs`

...

## `anime`

This is a great animation library with provides [incredible documentation](https://animejs.com/).

There is also a great package that provides us with React bindings for the library, which we'll be highlighting.
