Hey there! This is a repository that contains all of the notes for ACM @ UCLA's Learning Labs Crash Course, which we held online during the summer of 2020. We developed this series to give developers with **zero prior web development experience** enough of a primer to make high-quality beautiful and interactive front-end applications. 

While these notes are a good starting point, simply reading through all of these notes is not nearly enough to become a pro web developer! We aimed to give enough of a foundational background and a primer into each relevant area; however, to make great web applications, developers need to **practice aggressively**.
